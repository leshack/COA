;Initialize HL pair as memory pointer
;Get the count at 4200 into C - register
;Copy it in D - register (for bubble sort (N-1) times required)
;Get the first value in A - register
;Compare it with the value at next location
;If they are out of order, exchange the contents of A - register and Memory
;Decrement D - register content by 1
;Repeat steps 5 and 7 till the value in D - register become zero
;Decrement C - register content by 1
;Repeat steps 3 to 9 till the value in C - register becomes zero

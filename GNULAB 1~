;Algorithm
;Load the address of the first element  of the array in HL pair
;Move the count to B_reg
;Increment the pointer 
;Get the firdt data in A_reg
;Decrement the counter
;Increment the pointer
;Compare the content of the memory  address by HL pair with that of A_reg
;If carry = 1, go to step 10, if carry =0 go to step 9
;Move the content of Memory address by HL to A_reg
;Decrement the count
;Check for zero of the count.if ZF=0 go to step 6 or if ZF=1 go to the next step
;Store the smalllest data in memory
;Terminate the program
